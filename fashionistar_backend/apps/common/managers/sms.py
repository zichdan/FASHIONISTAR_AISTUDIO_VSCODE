    Centralized SMS Manager for handling all SMS communications.

    Features:
    - Supports both Synchronous and Asynchronous execution (via asyncio.to_thread).
    - Dynamic Provider Selection (handled transparently by admin_backend's DatabaseConfiguredSMSBackend).
    - Robust Error Handling and Logging for production reliability.
    - Unified Interface for sending SMS messages across different providers.

    This manager abstracts the complexity of SMS sending, providing a clean interface
    for the rest of the application. It leverages the DatabaseConfiguredSMSBackend for
    dynamic provider selection based on admin configurations.
